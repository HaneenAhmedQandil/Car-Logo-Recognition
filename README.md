# Car-Logo-Recognition
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras and TensorFlow for image classification. It includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and prediction. It also visualizes learned features. The application is adaptable to any image dataset, making it a great resource for deep learning enthusiasts.

This project is a deep learning model for image classification. It uses Keras and OpenCV to train a model on a dataset of images, and then uses the trained model to classify new images.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

You can install the Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install keras opencv-python matplotlib numpy
